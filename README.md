# Mood Ring NFT ‚Äì Dynamic NFTs Based on On-Chain Activity

**Mood Ring NFT** is a unique dynamic NFT system that reflects the behavioral patterns of its owner. Each NFT evolves over time based on the frequency and recency of interactions, transfers, and on-chain events. These evolving traits are reflected in mood states such as ‚ÄúEnergetic,‚Äù ‚ÄúCalm,‚Äù or ‚ÄúSocial,‚Äù which are determined by smart contract logic.

## üß† Mood Logic

### Mood States (Based on activity level):

| Mood ID | Mood Name     | Activity Threshold |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| `u1`    | Energetic     | > 80               |
| `u3`    | Excited       | > 60               |
| `u5`    | Social        | > 40               |
| `u4`    | Contemplative | > 20               |
| `u2`    | Calm          | ‚â§ 20               |

* Mood is updated whenever the token is **transferred**, **interacted with**, or **purchased**.
* **Activity levels** increase with interaction and decrease with time.
